# Mirrorbast

Mirrorbast is a simple desktop application designed to wrap the web-based card game client Karabast, so that it can be played by a single player using two decks, with easy setup and switching between two decks for testing purposes.

This application was built using Electron.

## ⚠️ Alpha Software - Expect Bugs! ⚠️

**Please be aware:** This application is currently in an **alpha** stage.

* It was developed rapidly over a couple of days, primarily using AI assistance ("vibe-coded").
* While functional for basic use, it has undergone limited testing.
* **Bugs are expected and likely.** Features might be incomplete or unstable.

Use this software with the understanding that it's an early experiment. Feel free to report issues or contribute if you're interested!

## Installation

The easiest way to install Mirrorbast is to download the latest release for your operating system from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/pmossman/mirrorbast/releases)** on GitHub.

Find the release corresponding to the version you want (usually the latest) and download the appropriate file for your system:

* **Windows:** Download the `.exe` file (e.g., `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.exe`).
* **macOS:** Download the `.dmg` file (e.g., `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-macos-arm64.dmg`). *(Note: Filename might vary slightly based on architecture)*.
* **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** Download the `.deb` file (e.g., `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.deb`).

### Running the Application

#### Windows

1.  Download the `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.exe` installer.
2.  Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to run the installer.
3.  **Important:** Windows Defender SmartScreen will likely show a warning ("Windows protected your PC") because the application is not code-signed by a recognized publisher.
    * Click **"More info"**.
    * Then click **"Run anyway"**.
4.  Follow the installer prompts. The application should install and launch.

#### macOS

1.  Download the `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-macos-arm64.dmg` file.
2.  Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file to open it.
3.  A window will appear showing the Mirrorbast application icon and usually a shortcut to your Applications folder.
4.  **Drag the Mirrorbast icon into the Applications folder.**
5.  **First Launch:** You might encounter a Gatekeeper warning ("Mirrorbast can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" or similar) because the app isn't notarized by Apple.
    * **Right-click** (or Control-click) the Mirrorbast application icon in your Applications folder.
    * Select **"Open"** from the context menu.
    * You might see the same warning again, but this time there will be an **"Open"** button. Click it.
    * You should only need to do this the first time you run this specific version.
6.  Eject the `.dmg` volume from your Finder sidebar when done.

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1.  Download the `mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.deb` file.
2.  You can usually install `.deb` files by double-clicking them in your file manager, which should open a package installer (like Ubuntu Software or GDebi).
3.  Alternatively, you can install it from the terminal:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file
    cd ~/Downloads 
    
    # Install the package (replace vX.Y.Z with the actual version)
    sudo dpkg -i mirrorbast-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.deb
    
    # If you encounter dependency issues, run:
    sudo apt-get install -f 
    ```
4.  Once installed, you should find Mirrorbast in your application menu.
